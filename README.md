# kaggle: otto-Multi-Objective Recommender System
 My solution, which was in (imaginary) third place at the end of the competition, is now available to the public.

## Solution Overview
Makotu part of this URL for solutions.
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/382879

## Code
Execute .ipynb and .py in order from 0 to 5 in the code folder.

Estimated execution times are as follows.  
preprocessing: about 1 day (especially clustering takes time)  
Make features: about 1 day  
Training & predict: about 1 day  

## Data
The data for the main source refers to data from radek.  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radek1/otto-full-optimized-memory-footprint  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radek1/otto-train-and-test-data-for-local-validation  
First put these data into "input/train_test" and "input/train_valid" before executing.

## environment
GPU memory: 24GB(RTX 3090)
CPU memory: 128GB
The system will work in the following environment.  
If you have less than that, it will probably stop working in places, so please adjust the code accordingly.
